# Message Board
Designed to showcase user creation and authentication, this app has varied functionality (and sidebar views!) based on the login status and permisions of a user. Anyone can create an account, but member and admin statuses require a specific passcode to unlock their respective functionalities.

## User Permisions
**Non-logged in user:** See the Message Board messages

**Logged in user:** See who posted each message as well as the timestamp for the message.

**Member:** You can contribute to Message Board by posting a new message! Your name and timestamp will automatically be added to the messages you post.

**Admin:** Can delete any post from the Message Board. This permission will not be given out to many.

### Inspirations
Project concept from The Odin Project as part of their NodeJS course. Design modeled after MDN's Express Tutorial: Local Library project.
